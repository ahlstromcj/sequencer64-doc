\section{Sequencer64 JACK Support}
\label{sec:seq64_jack}

   This section describes some details concerning the JACK support of
   \textsl{Sequencer64}.

   This section is just underway.  Here are some of the topics to be discussed:

   \begin{enumerate}
      \item What JACK functions are supported.
      \item Exposing the ALSA MIDI ports to JACK.
      \item Fixes to JACK Master mode.
      \item Interactions with the Klick and Hydrogen applications.
      \item Patches from the new (!) version of Seq24, 0.9.3, to correct
         for MIDI Clock drift.  It seems to have some issues, so that support
         is currently commented out.
   \end{enumerate}

   In the meantime, the text files in the project's \texttt{contrib/notes}
   directory provide some useful setup notes.

   First, if \textsl{Sequencer64} is run in JACK mode without JACK running on
   the system, it will take awhile to come up (in ALSA mode).  If run from the
   console, one will see:
