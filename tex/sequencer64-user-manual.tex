\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   This document describes \textsl{Sequencer64}
   \cite{sequencer64}, through version 0.94.0,
   the latest commit from the \textbf{master} branch.
   If one is impatient to get started mastering \textsl{Sequencer64},
   then proceed to \sectionref{subsec:introduction_lets_get_started}.

   \textsl{Sequencer64} has added native JACK MIDI support,
   and it fixes some bugs in JACK transport, MIDI clocking, and
   JACK Master mode (with code from the \textsl{SooperLooper} 
   and \textsl{Seq32} projects).
   However, as user \textsl{stazed} notes on GitHub, there is more that can be
   done (and he has done much with his \textsl{seq32} \cite{seq32} project).

   Many new features make song editing faster.
   There is now a Pause button/keystroke.
   More editing and navigation can be done using keystrokes.
   The armed/mute status of all of the \textsl{other} active patterns can be
   toggled.
%  All playing patterns can be muted, then unmuted.
   There are zoom keys for the editors, current-sequence highlighting,
   important bug fixes, some optimization, and much more.

   Nonetheless, we have many contributors to acknowledge.  Please see
   \sectionref{sec:kudos}.

\subsection{Sequencer64: What?}
\label{subsec:what_is_sequencer64}

   \textsl{Sequencer64} is an reboot of \textsl{Seq24},
   a live-looping sequencer with an interface more like a hardware sequencer
   than the typical software MIDI sequencer.
   \textsl{Seq24} was a very active project, with a
   number of contributors, who created patches, additional
   functionality, and even ports to Windows.
   We searched for these updates, and
   incorporated them into \textsl{Sequencer64} where feasible.
   There are still some things to be done, including a port to Windows.

   \textsl{Sequencer64} is not a synthesizer.  It requires a hardware
   synthesizer, or a software synthesizer such as Timidity \cite{timidity},
   FluidSynth \cite{fluidsynth}, ZynAddSubFX \cite{zynaddsubfx}, Yoshimi
   \cite{yoshimi} \cite{yoshimi2}, etc.
   See \cite{linuxsynths} for a long list of "Linux" synthesizers).

   \textsl{Sequencer64}, like \textsl{Seq24},
   works a bit like an \textsl{Alesis SR16} drum machine,
   which, for some, is a very intuitive and fast way to do MIDI.
   If one has worked with trackers like \textsl{SoundTracker} and
   \textsl{ShakeTracker}, then "you are a tracker guy and it gonna go fast".
   With \textsl{Sequencer64}, one creates several patterns, and then
   combines them.

   Unfortunately, \textsl{Seq24} spent some time in limbo
   (2010 was the last major update, with a
   recent update to fix a MIDI clock issue).  There are a number of
   forks for it on \textsl{GitHub}, and some conversions
   to code in other languages, and some patches.
   There is also a fairly extensive port to Windows.
   So, why would we bother creating yet another fork of \textsl{Seq24}?

\subsection{Sequencer64: Why?}
\label{subsec:introduction_seq64_vs_others}

   The first reason to reboot \textsl{Seq24} is consolidation of many of the
   features and fixes that it has accumulated in various forks over the years.
   Also, although "feature-complete", additional features would be useful, such
   as support for modern session managers, more use of keystrokes,
%  work-arounds for the need for two mouse buttons,
%  a more modern user-interface framework,
   more comprehensive undo/redo,
   bug fixes, improving the "user" configuration file,
   and a way to edit parts of the MIDI file textually.

   Secondly, \textsl{Seq24} is a kind of "vi" of MIDI editing... spare,
   lean, and powerful.  It deserves to be a living project.  Without
   \textsl{Seq24} and its authors, \textsl{Sequencer64} would never have come
   into being.

\subsection{Improvements}
\label{subsec:improvements}

   The following improvements have been made to \textsl{Seq24} for
   \textsl{Sequencer64}.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item An important update is native JACK MIDI support!  At last!
      \item Tempo events are now supported, are recordable, and are editable.
         The first track (or a configurable track) serves as a "tempo track".
      \item A "Tap" button sets the BPM by tapping a button or a key.
      \item The user interface can show more than one set at
         once.  More information on the current screen!
      \item The user interface can show more patterns in a
         single set.  For example, 8 rows by 8 columns, fulfilling the promise
         of the project name, \textsl{Sequencer64}.
      \item The \textsl{event editor} dialog
         provides viewing and editing of MIDI events as text.
         This editor is basic, but useful.
      \item \textsl{Sequencer64} reads SMF 0 MIDI files, splitting
         the file into patterns based on channel number.
      \item Additional MIDI controls, such as coarse versus fine BPM control.
      \item Some features have been ported from \textsl{Stazed}'s
         \textsl{Seq32} \cite{seq32} project.  Some features can be disabled at
         configure/build time, if desired.
         \begin{itemize}
            \item The chord-generation feature of \textsl{Seq32}.
            \item Pattern-transposing.
            \item MIDI song export, which
               allows a song/performance to be exported into a MIDI file
               without \textsl{Sequencer64} loops, so that the performance can be
               played in a standard MIDI sequencer.
            \item The extended undo/redo support of \textsl{Seq32} has been
               ported to \textsl{Sequencer64}.
            \item The ability to split triggers at the nearest snap, instead
               simply splitting them in half.
            \item Editing the amplitude of data events using a simple
               low-frequency oscillator (LFO).
            \item Enhanced JACK transport support.
            \item A number of other \textsl{Seq32} features have been
               ported, but they are still pending:
            \begin{itemize}
               \item Diverting multi-channel recorded MIDI so that each channel
                  is stored in the sequence/pattern configured for that channel
               \item Randomizing MIDI events.
               \item Selection extensions such as selecting odd/even notes, and
                  handles on data events.
               \item More features for controlling transport.
            \end{itemize}
         \end{itemize}
      \item An optional second song editor window, to have a view
         of two different parts of a large song while arranging it.
      \item Set Tempo and Time Signature events are
         now processed, incorporated into the user-interface, and are saved
         as standard MIDI data.  Support for System Exclusive events is
         improving.
      \item The scale, key, and background sequence
         settings are now saved to the \textsl{Sequencer64} MIDI file, either
         globally or per-sequence.
      \item In the sequence/pattern and song editors, the piano roll
         now scrolls to keep up with the progress bar for patterns longer than
         the width of the sequence editor window.
      \item Additional mouse and keystroke support in the pattern and song
         editor windows:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Usage of Page Up, Page Down, and Shift Page Up, Shift Page Down,
            to move vertically and horizontally in the pattern and song
            windows.
         \item Moving selected notes or triggers using the arrow keys.
         \item Pasting selected notes (and other events) using the arrow and
            Enter keys.
         \item Additional keystroke support for entering and exiting "paint"
            mode.
         \item Usage of the Mod4 (Super, Windows) key to keep editing
            (painting) mode enabled after releasing the right mouse button;
            useful with some "modern" crappy uni-touchpads.
         \item Shift-left-click on a pattern slot (pattern editor),
            or on the pattern name or M (mute) (song editor)
            to toggle the status of all of the other active slots.
            Useful for listening to a single track by itself.
         \item Right-click on a the virtual keyboard in the pattern editor
            toggles between showing letters/octaves (e.g. "C4") versus
            the MIDI note numbers.  
      \end{itemize}
      \item The "user" configuration can now be written to disk, and 
         settings are adding to it as time goes on.  It currently offers the
         long-standing feature of customizable buss, instrument, and controller
         information, plus some customizations of the user-interface, such as
         font, display of the main window's pattern grid, colored and thicker
         progress bars, modification of the default 40 millisecond window
         redraw rate, changes in the row and column sizes of a set, and showing
         multiple sets in the main window.
      \item Support for mapping MIDI events to a single MIDI buss for testing
         or simple use cases.
      \item On-going support for handling PPQN values other than the
         default value of 192.
      \item Small improvements in appearance:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Support for showing empty (having only meta
            events) sequences in a highlight color (yellow).
         \item Support for highlighting the currently-focussed pattern editor
            window, in black-on-cyan if not armed, and in cyan-on-black if
            armed.  The highlighting appears in both the pattern and song
            editors.
         \item Sequences that are shorter than a quarter note are now padded to
            one full measure, for smoother scrolling on the patterns panel.
         \item Modification of the colors of the scale and background sequence
            in the sequence editor to make it easier to see them all.
         \item A new font, enabled at run time, that is bolder and has a
            more modern, anti-aliased look.
         \item Clean, solid lines to replace the dotted lines in the piano-roll
            grids.
         \item Additional zoom values have been added to support the display
            of high PPQN sequences.
         \item An "inverse" or "night" color mode has been added for those
            who find the glare of all-white windows to be uncomfortable.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Consolidated various patches in forks of the \textsl{Seq24}
         project found by searching the web.  Fixes to bugs found while
         refactoring \textsl{Seq24} were also made.  These fixes are noted in
         detail in the project's ROADMAP and contrib/notes/bugs-to-investigate
         files.
      \item Recording of performance changes into the Song Editor.
      \item More musical scales (harmonic minor, melodic minor,
         whole tone, etc.) have been added.
      \item A pause feature, added to ALSA-mode playback,
         includes a pause keystroke (".") and a pause button.
      \item A multiple-set main-window build and run-time option can now
         show more than one set in the main window.
      \item Internal improvements.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Provided a new, more MIDI-compliant output format for the MIDI
            files.  The old format can still be read, and, with a "legacy"
            option, be written.
         \item Changed the handling of the MIDI event container, which greatly
            speeds up the loading of a MIDI file.
%           If the new container reduces the maximum output of the sequencer,
%           we will dump the slow container into a vector container for faster
%           playback.
         \item Note-transpose now also works on aftertouch events.
         \item Non-note events are now copied, moved, or pasted, even if not
            visible, in the pattern editor.
         \item The code was reformatted using \textsl{astyle} and
            personal preferences, and refactored into smaller modules.
         \item Much documentation was added to the code as we figured
            out how it worked.  Generation of Doxygen output (including a PDF
            file) provides a developer's reference manual.
         \item Debian packaging was incorporated into the project to make it
            easier to install without source code.  Bootstrapping and
            packing scripts were added so that other developers can rebuild the
            project from scratch.
      \end{itemize}
      \item New minor features.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item The size of the Patterns Panel (main window) is now locked.
         \item A panic button.
         \item Support for LASH is a run-time or a build option.
         \item Support for reading and writing configuration files from the
            user's \texttt{\$HOME/.config/sequencer64} directory, or,
            optionally, other directories.
      \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

   Eventually, we plan to create a build
   for Windows, using MingW, a fairly significant task.
   We've also been asked to incorporate support for 
   a scripting language, for OSC (Open Sound
   Control), and for NSM (the Non Session Manager).

   One more note.  \textsl{Sequencer64} is extremely customizable, and
   it features can be configured by defining macro names in the source code,
   by enabling/disabling options at build-configuration time, and by many new
   command-line arguments.  We cannot show all permutations of settings in this
   document, so don't be surprised if some screenshots don't quite match
   one's setup.

\subsection{Document Structure}
\label{subsec:introduction_document_structure}

   The structure of this document follows the user-interface of
   \textsl{Sequencer64}.  The sections are provided in the order
   their contents appear in the user interface of \textsl{Sequencer64}.  To
   help the reader jump around this document, it provides
   multiple links, references, and index entries.

   \textsl{Usage tips}
   \index{tips!documented}
   for each of the functions provided in
   \textsl{Sequencer64} are sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each tip occurs in a section beginning with "\textbf{Tip:}".
   Each tip is provided with an entry in the index, under the
   main topic "tips".

   \textsl{Bug notes}
   \index{bugs!documented}
   for some of the oddities found in \textsl{Sequencer64} are
   sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each bug occurs in a sentence beginning with "\textbf{Bug:}".
   Each bug is provided with an entry in the index, under the
   main topic "bugs".  These bugs are items that we will try to
   fix as time goes on.

   \textsl{"To-do" items}
   \index{todo!documented}
   are also present, again in the same vein.
   Each to-do occurs in a sentence beginning with "\textbf{TODO:}".
   This document currently has a lot of them!

   \textsl{"New" items}
   \index{new!documented}
   are also present, in the same vein.
   New features (post version 0.9.2) will be noted with the tag
   "\textbf{New:}".

\subsection{Let's Get Started!}
\label{subsec:introduction_lets_get_started}

   Let us run \textsl{Sequencer64}.
   The first
   thing to do is make sure one has no other sound application running
   (unless one wants to risk blocking \textsl{Sequencer64} or hearing two
   sounds simultaneously, depending on one's sound card and ALSA setup).
   Then start \textsl{Sequencer64} so that it uses JACK for MIDI.  Provide a
   default MIDI file so that all elements of the user interface can come
   into play.  Also use the "\&" character so that we get back to the
   command-line prompt.  Finally, on our system the main synthesizer
   (\textsl{Yoshimi}) comes up on MIDI buss 5, so we add an option to remap
   all events to that buss:

%  $ sequencer64 --alsa --bus 5 contrib/midi/b4uacuse-seq24.midi &

\begin{verbatim}
   $ seq64 --jack-midi --bus 5 contrib/midi/b4uacuse-seq24.midi &
\end{verbatim}

   If the \texttt{--alsa} option is used instead of
   \texttt{--jack-midi}, then the "Native" button will show "ALSA" instead.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
%  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{seq64-first-screen.png}
%  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{new/seq64_first_screen.png}
%  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{seq64-first-screen-new-buttons.png}
%  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{new/seq64-first-screen-jack.png}
%  \caption{Sequencer64 Main Screen, Native JACK MIDI}
%  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{new/seq64-first-screen-alsa.png}
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{new/seq64-first-screen-alsa-panic.png}
   \caption{Sequencer64 Main Screen, ALSA MIDI}
   \label{fig:seq64_main_screen}
\end{figure}

   Then the \textsl{Sequencer64} main window appears, as shown in
   \figureref{fig:seq64_main_screen}.  It has some differences
   from the \textsl{Seq24} main window: the highlighting of
   empty patterns in yellow, a different font, additional control buttons,
   and much more that is not shown.
   Most of these items can be configured via the "rc" and "user" configuration
   files or command-line options.

   There are many new front-panel items in \textsl{Sequencer64}:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Top panel control buttons:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Toggle and show the status of "Live" mode versus "Song" mode.
         \item Mute/show the mute status of all tracks.
         \item Enable/disable the menu bar and show its status.
         \item Set/show "JACK" transport, "ALSA" mode, or "Native" (JACK) mode.
      \end{itemize}
      \item Current time in bars, beats, and ticks.
      \item Panic button, to stop all tracks and turn off all notes.
      \item Start, Stop, and Pause.
      \item Song recording records all muting changes to the Song Editor.
      \item Song-recording snap, the \textbf{S} button.
      \item Tap Tempo, the \textbf{0} (zero) button.
      \item Log Tempo, which inserts the current tempo into the tempo track
         as an event.
      \item Tempo recording, which inserts all tempo changes as tempo events.
      \item Keep-queue toggling and status.
   \end{itemize}

   Many of these buttons have configurable keystrokes as well.
   See \sectionref{subsec:seq64_patterns_panel_bottom} for more information.
