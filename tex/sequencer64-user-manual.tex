\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   This document describes \textsl{Sequencer64}
   \cite{sequencer64}, through version 0.96.0.
   The following projects support \textsl{Sequencer64}:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \url{https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64.git}.
      \item \url{https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-doc.git}.
      \item \url{https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-packages.git}.
   \end{itemize}

   If impatient to get started mastering \textsl{Sequencer64},
   proceed to \sectionref{subsec:introduction_lets_get_started}.
   Otherwise, read about the new features of \textsl{Sequencer64}
   relative to \textsl{Seq24}.

   \textsl{Sequencer64} adds native JACK MIDI support,
   fixes bugs in JACK transport, MIDI clocking,
   JACK Master mode,
%  an additional \textsl{Qt 5} user-interface for Linux and for Windows,
   a daemon mode, play-list support with MIDI control,
   and more.
   \textsl{Sequencer64} can also be build to run as a "headless" application,
   from the command-line or as a Linux daemon, controlled via MIDI control.
%  There is a Pause button/keystroke.
   More editing and navigation can be done using keystrokes,
   for faster editing.
%  The armed/mute status of all of the \textsl{other} active patterns can be
%  toggled.
   There are zoom keys for the editors, current-sequence highlighting,
   important bug fixes, and some optimization.
   With version 0.95.0, \textsl{Sequencer64} supports
   \textsl{Microsoft Windows}, via 
   a modified version of PortMidi and by
   adopting and extending the \textsl{Qt 5} user-interface of the
   \textsl{Kepler34} project (\cite{kepler34}).
%  We intend to make the \textsl{Qt 5} interface comparable to the
%  \textsl{Gtkmm-2.4} interface in the 0.95 series, develop the two
%  versions in parallel for awhile, and ultimately standardize on
%  \textsl{Qt 5}, as it seems to be a bit more portable than Gtkmm-3.
   See \sectionref{sec:qt_portmidi}, right away, if \textsl{Qt 5} and
   \textsl{Windows} support excites you.
   Please note that support for \textsl{Mac OSX} should be easy now,
   but we need help on that support, since we do not have a \textsl{Mac}.

   We have many contributors to acknowledge.  Please see
   \sectionref{sec:kudos}.

\subsection{Sequencer64: What?}
\label{subsec:what_is_sequencer64}

   \textsl{Sequencer64} is an reboot of \textsl{Seq24},
   a live-looping sequencer with an interface more like a hardware sequencer
   than track-based MIDI sequencers.
   \textsl{Seq24} was a very active project, with a
   number of contributors, who created patches, additional
   functionality, and ports to Windows.
   We searched for these updates, and
   incorporated them into \textsl{Sequencer64} where feasible.

   \textsl{Sequencer64} is not a synthesizer.  It requires a hardware
   synthesizer, or a software synthesizer such as Timidity \cite{timidity},
   FluidSynth \cite{fluidsynth}, or
%  , ZynAddSubFX \cite{zynaddsubfx}, Yoshimi
%  \cite{yoshimi} \cite{yoshimi2}, or
   the Windows built-in GS wave-table synthesizer.
%  See \cite{linuxsynths} for a list of "Linux" synthesizers.

   \textsl{Sequencer64}, like \textsl{Seq24},
   works like an \textsl{Alesis SR16} drum machine,
   which, for some, is a very intuitive and fast way to do MIDI.
   If one has worked with trackers like \textsl{SoundTracker} and
   \textsl{ShakeTracker}, then "you are a tracker guy and it gonna go fast".
   With \textsl{Sequencer64}, one creates several patterns, and then
   combines them.  They can be layed out as a performance,
   and exported to a standard MIDI file.

   \textsl{Seq24} spent some time inactive
   (2010 was the last major update, with a
   recent update to fix a MIDI clock issue).  There are a number of
   forks for it on \textsl{GitHub}, and some conversions
   to code in other languages, and some patches.
   There is also a Gtkmm port to Windows.
   So, why bother creating yet another fork of \textsl{Seq24}?

\subsection{Sequencer64: Why?}
\label{subsec:introduction_seq64_vs_others}

   The first reason to reboot \textsl{Seq24} is consolidation of many of the
   features and fixes that it has accumulated in various forks over the years.
   Also, although "feature-complete", additional features would be useful.
%  Such as support for modern session managers, more use of keystrokes,
%  work-arounds for the need for two mouse buttons,
%  a more modern user-interface framework,
%  more comprehensive undo/redo,
%  bug fixes, improving the "user" configuration file,
%  and a way to edit parts of the MIDI file textually.

   Secondly, \textsl{Seq24} is a kind of "vi" of MIDI editing... spare,
   lean, and powerful.  It deserves to be a living project.  Without
   \textsl{Seq24} and its authors, \textsl{Sequencer64} would never have come
   into being.
%  And we owe the \textbf{Qt} support to \textsl{Kepler34} \cite{kepler34}.

\subsection{Improvements}
\label{subsec:improvements}

   The following improvements are just some that have been made in
   \textsl{Sequencer64}.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Native JACK MIDI support!  At last!
      \item Tempo events are recordable and editable, in the first track.
      \item A "Tap" button sets the BPM by tapping a button or a key.
      \item Supports more than one visible screen-set (multi-set),
         or more patterns in a single set (variset).
      \item The \textsl{event editor}
         provides basic viewing and editing of MIDI events as text.
      \item \textsl{Sequencer64} reads SMF 0 MIDI files, split
         into slots based on channel number.
      \item Many new MIDI controls, such as coarse versus fine BPM control.
      \item Support for basic reading (not writing) of
         \index{Cakewalk}
         \textsl{Cakewalk} "WRK" files.
      \item Play-list support, with the option to control it via MIDI events.
      \item Some features ported from \textsl{Stazed}'s
         \textsl{Seq32} \cite{seq32} project:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Chord-generation.
            \item Pattern-transposing.
            \item MIDI performance export to a standard MIDI file.
            \item Extended undo/redo support, better detection of changes.
            \item Splitting triggers at the nearest snap, if desired.
            \item Modulating data events with a low-frequency oscillator (LFO).
            \item Enhanced JACK transport support.
            \item Diverting multi-channel MIDI into into channel-specific slots.
         \end{itemize}
%     \item A second song editor window, to view
%        two parts of a large performance when arranging it.
      \item Set Tempo and Time Signature events are handled,
         shown, and saved as standard MIDI data.
      \item Scale, key, and background sequences
         are saved to the \textsl{Sequencer64} MIDI file.
      \item Pattern coloring, saved in the sequence.
      \item Piano roll scrolling to keep up with the progress bar.
      \item Additional mouse and keystroke support for faster editing.
%     \begin{itemize}
%        \item Usage of Page Up, Page Down, and Shift Page Up, Shift Page Down,
%           to move vertically and horizontally in the pattern and song
%           windows.
%        \item Moving selected notes or triggers using the arrow keys.
%        \item Pasting selected notes (and other events) using the arrow and
%           Enter keys.
%        \item Additional keystroke support for entering and exiting "paint"
%           mode.
%        \item Usage of the Mod4 (Super, Windows) key to keep editing
%           (painting) mode enabled after releasing the right mouse button;
%           useful with some "modern" crappy uni-touchpads.
%        \item Shift-left-click on a pattern slot (pattern editor),
%           or on the pattern name or "M" (mute) label (song editor)
%           to toggle the status of all of the other active slots.
%           Useful for listening to a single track by itself.
%        \item Right-click on a the virtual keyboard in the pattern editor
%           toggles between showing letters/octaves (e.g. "C4") versus
%           the MIDI note numbers.  
%     \end{itemize}
      \item The "user" configuration can be saved
         (\texttt{--user-save} option); it has \textsl{many} new settings.
%        It offers the
%        long-standing feature of customizable buss, instrument, and controller
%        information, plus some customizations of the user-interface, such as
%        font, display of the main window's pattern grid, colored and thicker
%        progress bars, modification of the default 40 millisecond window
%        redraw rate, changes in the row and column sizes of a set, and showing
%        multiple sets in the main window.
      \item An option to map events to a single MIDI buss for testing.
      \item Support for additional PPQN values, including
         the PPQN of the MIDI file.
      \item Improvements in appearance, too many to mention here.
%     \begin{itemize}
%        \item Support for showing empty (having only meta
%           events) sequences in a highlight color (yellow).
%        \item Support for highlighting the currently-focussed pattern editor
%           window, in black-on-cyan if not armed, and in cyan-on-black if
%           armed.  The highlighting appears in both the pattern and song
%           editors.
%        \item Sequences that are shorter than a quarter note are now padded to
%           one full measure, for smoother scrolling on the patterns panel.
%        \item Modification of the colors of the scale and background sequence
%           in the sequence editor to make it easier to see them all.
%        \item A new font, enabled at run time, that is bolder and has an
%           anti-aliased look.
%        \item Clean, solid lines to replace the dotted lines in the piano-roll
%           grids.
%        \item Additional zoom values have been added to support the display
%           of high PPQN sequences.
%        \item An "inverse" or "night" color mode has been added for those
%           who find the glare of all-white windows to be uncomfortable.
%     \end{itemize}
      \item Many, many bug fixes, faster than we create them!
%     \item Consolidated patches in forks of the \textsl{Seq24}
%        project found by searching the web.  Fixes to bugs found while
%        refactoring \textsl{Seq24} were also made.
      \item Recording of performance changes into the Song Editor.
      \item More musical scales
%        (harmonic minor, melodic minor, whole tone, etc.)
         have been added.
      \item A pause feature, with a pause key (".") and pause button.
%     \item A multiple-set main-window build/run-time option
%        shows more than one set in the main window. (Gtkmm only).
      \item Internal improvements.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Provided a new, more MIDI-compliant output format for the MIDI
            files.
%           The old format can still be read, and, with a "legacy"
%           option, be written.
         \item Reworked the MIDI event container, to
            speed the loading of a MIDI file.
%           If the new container reduces the maximum output of the sequencer,
%           we will dump the slow container into a vector container for faster
%           playback.
         \item Note-transpose now also works on aftertouch events.
         \item Non-note events are copied/moved/pasted in the pattern editor.
%        \item The code was reformatted using \textsl{astyle} and
%           personal preferences, and refactored into smaller modules.
%        \item Much documentation added to the code during reverse
%           engineering.
         \item Debian packaging added into the project.
%           to make it
%           easier to install without source code.  Bootstrapping and
%           packing scripts were added so that other developers can rebuild the
%           project from scratch easily.
         \item The Qt 5 version (the future of \textsl{Sequencer64}) for
            Windows is built using Qmake and MingW.
         \item \textsl{Sequencer64 for Windows} provides a
            portable zip package and NSIS-based installer.
      \end{itemize}
%     \item New minor features.
%     \begin{itemize}
%        \item The size of the Patterns Panel (main window) is now locked (only
%        for the Gtkmm-2.4 version).
%        \item A panic button.
%        \item Support for LASH is a run-time or a build option.
%        \item Support for reading and writing configuration files from the
%           user's \texttt{\$HOME/.config/sequencer64} directory, or,
%           optionally, other directories or files.
%     \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

%  We've also been asked to incorporate support for 
%  a scripting language, for OSC (Open Sound
%  Control), and for NSM (the Non Session Manager).
%  Still thinking about those.

   For developers, \textsl{Sequencer64} is extremely customizable via C macros,
   by enabling/disabling options at build-configuration time, and by many
   command-line arguments.  We cannot show all permutations of settings in this
   document, so don't be surprised if some screenshots don't quite match
   one's setup.  Distro maintainers might pick their favorite build
   configurations.

\subsection{Document Structure}

   The structure of this document follows the user-interface of
   \textsl{Sequencer64}.  The sections are provided in the order
   their contents appear in the user-interface of \textsl{Sequencer64}.  To
   help the reader jump around this document, it provides
   multiple links, references, and index entries.

%  \textsl{Usage tips}
%  \index{tips!documented}
%  for each of the functions provided in
%  \textsl{Sequencer64} are sprinkled throughout this document.
%  Each tip occurs in a section beginning with "\textbf{Tip:}".

\subsection{Let's Get Started!}
\label{subsec:introduction_lets_get_started}

   Let's run \textsl{Sequencer64}!
   Make sure no other sound application is running
   (unless one wants to risk blocking \textsl{Sequencer64} or hearing two
   applications simultaneously, depending on one's operating system,
   sound card, and audio setup).
   Start \textsl{Sequencer64} so that it uses JACK for MIDI.
   On \textsl{Windows} just run it (\texttt{qpseq64.exe}), JACK is not
   supported on \textsl{Windows}.
   Provide a MIDI file so that all elements of the user-interface can come
   into play.  On \textsl{Linux}, the "\&" character get us back to the
   command-line prompt.  Finally, on our system the main synthesizer
   (\textsl{Yoshimi}) comes up on MIDI buss 5, so we add an option to remap
   all events to that buss:

\begin{verbatim}
   $ seq64 --jack-midi --bus 5 contrib/midi/b4uacuse-seq24.midi &
   C:\> qpseq64 --bus 1  contrib/midi/b4uacuse-seq24.midi
\end{verbatim}

   If the \texttt{--alsa} option is used instead of
   \texttt{--jack-midi}, then the "JACK" button shows "ALSA" instead
   (Linux 'rtmidi' build only).

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{new/seq64-first-screen-0-96-qt.png}
   \caption{Sequencer64 Main Screen, Qt 5 Interface}
   \label{fig:seq64_main_screen_qt}
\end{figure}

   The \textsl{Sequencer64} main window appears, as shown in
   \figureref{fig:seq64_main_screen} and
   \figureref{fig:seq64_main_screen_qt}.
   These figures have some differences from the \textsl{Seq24} main window
   and from each other, but the functionality is roughly the same.
   Most features can be configured via the "rc" and "user"
   configuration files or command-line options.
   There are many new front-panel items in \textsl{Sequencer64}, but only for
   the Gtkmm-2.4 version:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Top panel control buttons:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Toggle and show the status of "Live" mode versus "Song" mode.
         \item Mute/show the mute status of all tracks.
         \item Enable/disable the menu bar and show its status.
         \item Set/show JACK "Slave" transport, "Master" transport,
            "ALSA" mode, or "JACK" (native JACK) mode.
         \item Set the kind of time display, between "bars:beat:ticks"
            and "hours:minute:seconds".
      \end{itemize}
      \item Current time in bars, beats, and ticks.
      \item Panic button, to stop all tracks and turn off all notes.
      \item Start, Stop, and Pause.
      \item Song recording records all muting changes to the Song Editor.
      \item Song-recording snap, the \textbf{S} button.
      \item Tap Tempo, the \textbf{0} (zero) button.
      \item Log Tempo, which inserts the current tempo into the tempo track
         as an event. Gtkmm-2.4 only.
      \item Tempo recording, which inserts all tempo changes as tempo events.
         Gtkmm-2.4 only.
      \item Keep-queue toggling and status.
   \end{itemize}

   Many (but not all) of these buttons have configurable keystrokes as well.
   See \sectionref{subsec:seq64_patterns_panel_bottom}.
   Some of these items are not in the Qt interface.

% This Tip needs to be put elsewhere.
%
%  \textbf{Tip:}
%  \index{tips!tooltips}
%  \index{tooltips}
%  As with most user-interfaces, holding the mouse over some user-interface
%  elements for a short period will let one view a description (tooltip)
%  of what it does.
