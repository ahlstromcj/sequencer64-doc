[midi-control]

# The leftmost number on each line here is the pattern number, from
# 0 to 31 (and beyond for the mute-groups). Next, there are three
# groups of bracketed numbers that follow:
#
#    [toggle]  [on]  [off]
#
# In each group, there are six numbers:
#
#    [on/off invert status d0 d1min d1max]
#
# 'on/off' enables/disables (1/0) the MIDI control for the pattern.
# 'invert' (1/0) causes the opposite if data is outside the range.
# 'status' is by MIDI event to match (channel is NOT ignored).
# 'd0' is the first data value.  Example: if status is 144 (Note On),
# then d0 represents Note 0.
# 'd1min'/'d1max' are the range of second values that should match.
# Example:  For a Note On for note 0, 0 and 127 indicate that any
# Note On velocity will cause the MIDI control to take effect.

84      # MIDI controls count (74 or 84)
