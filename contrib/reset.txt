   I created this MIDI file out of frustration when I would play one
   particular MIDI file and certain ones I played after it sounded wrong
   (wrong instruments, the absence of some instruments, and so on).  Also,
   every now and then I would get hold of a MIDI file that had a stuck note
   at the end of it and the only way to stop it was to reboot the system or
   load up my copy of Cakewalk Apprentice (by Twelve Tone Systems, Inc.) and
   hit the Panic Button in it.  What I wanted was a MIDI file version of
   Cakewalk Apprentice's Panic button.  With some help from their Tech
   Support and my own investigation, this is what I've come up with.

   Also found at that site, included as a ready-made GM-compliant file
   to test.
