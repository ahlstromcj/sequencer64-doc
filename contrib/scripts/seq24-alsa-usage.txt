This section documents using the Seq24 sequencer with Yoshimi
over ALSA.

Why Seq24?  It is a smallish looping sequencer without a lot of bloat, but
still fairly powerful.  Also, it supports ALSA.

Why ALSA?  For demonstration purposes, we don't want to deal with the
complexities of JACK.  Our demonstration setup is very simple:  Seq24 out to
Yoshimi in.

The first thing to do make sure there are no instances of seq24 already
running, and then start seq24.  Once it starts, verify that the input and
output MIDI ports for Seq24 are present:

   $ killall seq24
   $ seq24 click_4_4.midi &
   $ aplaymidi -l
    Port    Client name                      Port name
   129:16   seq24                            seq24 in
   $ arecordmidi -
    Port    Client name                      Port name
   129:0    seq24                            [1] seq24 1
   129:1    seq24                            [2] seq24 2
   129:2    seq24                            [3] seq24 3
   129:3    seq24                            [4] seq24 4
   129:4    seq24                            [5] seq24 5
   129:5    seq24                            [6] seq24 6
   129:6    seq24                            [7] seq24 7
   129:7    seq24                            [8] seq24 8
   129:8    seq24                            [9] seq24 9
   129:9    seq24                            [10] seq24 10
   129:10   seq24                            [11] seq24 11
   129:11   seq24                            [12] seq24 12
   129:12   seq24                            [13] seq24 13
   129:13   seq24                            [14] seq24 14
   129:14   seq24                            [15] seq24 15
   129:15   seq24                            [16] seq24 16

This means that there is one input to play MIDI through ALSA
into Seq24, and that Seq24 can play into 16 MIDI devices using
ALSA.

Make sure that MPD (or some other audio-hogging application) isn't running,
if your system isn't problem set up to dmix.  Now run one instance of
Yoshimi, using ALSA:

   $ killall yoshimi
   $ yoshimi --alsa-midi=129:seq24 --alsa-audio &

On our setup, running QJackCtl (no JACK running) shows, in the ALSA tab,
an output ALSA port "129:seq24" and a input ALSA ports "129:seq24" and
"130:yoshimi".  Yoshimi doesn't appear in the -l (list) option of
aplaymidi and arecordmidi, oddly enough.
